                    The oldest of three girls, I grew up a little bossy, very talkative, independent, and hardworking. I was naturally motivated in school and performed well all the way through college, graduating with three majors: Physics, Math, and French. This is still one of my proudest accomplishments as a young adult. After undergrad I began a graduate program in Materials Science & Engineering, thinking that I would go towards a more practical route for a career. However, I found out quickly that I didn't enjoy it at all. I left the program and came back home. In my soul searching I decided to begin my journey to become a school teacher. I taught physics and oceanography for three years until I came to the conclusion that this too was not going to be the best fit for me, career wise, either. I knew I had to leave teaching, and with the cyclical timing of a school year combined with the timing of my decisions, I left my job at the conclusion of a school year. At this time I only had basic, initial thoughts about potential next steps in my life. Truly, I was terrified about what I would do next and how every aspect of my life would be affected. I'm a deteremined soul, though, and so it was back to the drawing board. This time around I took my soul searching a little more seriously. My heart strings kept pulling towards the idea of computer programming, and thus began my latest exciting adventure!

                    When I'm not working long hours on my new craft of coding, I enjoy caring for my pet chameleon, making home improvements, visiting family, traveling, watching sports, going to concerts, catching up with friends, and spending time outdoors. Another hobby that I've started taking more seriously recently, and requires plenty of time and research, is landlording! It's not easy folks. I stay really busy between all of these activities, and so I really value any time I can to take care of myself and overall health as well. Really I'm just a well-rounded, loud-mouthed, friendly, red-head-by-choice, young adult female who's really excited about this new adventure into this full stack coding bootcamp!
