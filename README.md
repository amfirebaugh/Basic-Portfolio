# Basic-Portfolio

-Most of my commented notes are on the "home" pages, or index.html and index.css just an fyi.

-This was in fact challenging, and fun! Still, it was pretty testing knowing that there's this beautiful Boostrap available and fighting with floats and positioning (or desperately trying to get around them...). I totally understand the need to learn the basics first, though, and that's why I kept sticking to this assignment the best I could. So many of the memes or gifs from the powerpoint decks were replaying in my head over and over again while completing this...especially the one with the guy trying to put his sheets on his bed...#CSSprobs.

-My final assignment is not perfect, but I tried my best, so I'm still proud of the end result and all the knowledge gained! 

-I'm just cheesy, and these reflection/journal-like entries are kind of important to my documentation process. I have to say, I'm really really really loving all of this so far! And yes, in a work environment I'll keep this stuff to myself. Ex-teacher to teacher (in case you happen to read the README file) maybe you'll find this humorous. :)


-Things I would have liked to finish coding/debugging:
+tiny vertical grey dividers between links
+my missing background image! I had it for the longest time and all the sudden it disappeared and I don't know whyyyy
+Copyright positioning on Contact and Portfolio pages
+alignment of the form boxes and the form text (i.e. prompt/"Name, Email," etc.) on the Contact page
+not sure about tiny bit of white space above my navbar at the very top of my page....but it's bugging me!
